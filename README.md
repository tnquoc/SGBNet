# SGBNet

This is the official implementation of ShuffleGhostBottleneck (SGB) model used in the paper ["Efficient ECG Classification with Light Weight Shuffle GhostNet Architecture"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10318918)

## Usage
- **SGBModel.py**: the vanilla SGB model
- **SBGModel_cinc2021**: the modified SGB model to serve ECG challenge task in paper ["Efficient ECG Classification with Light Weight Shuffle GhostNet Architecture"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10318918)
